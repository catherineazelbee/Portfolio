                <h1> Concept Art and Development </h1>
                <div class="project-info-text">
                    <p> Animation 1 at Northeastern is a class focused on a singular project, with the semester being
                        split into two halves. First, we spent time modeling our respective rooms and learning
                        fundamentals of
                        modeling with Autodesk Maya. The second half was focused on modeling our character and rigging,
                        utilizing Maya for
                        modeling and Advanced Skeleton for our rigs. However, before any of this, I had to develop my
                        concept. Although the final assignment was just a character performing an action in a room, I
                        knew I wanted to take the project a step further by creating a short film.
                    </p>

                    </div>
                    <p> Mindy is a pre-existing original character of mine, and I knew I wanted her to be the focus of
                        my Animation 1 project. For class
                        presentation, I referenced this piece of character art when explaining my concept. For
                        reference, Mindy is a human
                        character cursed with her less-than-ordinary appearance.

                    </div>
                    <p> Next, I drew concept images of what the enviroment should be like. I wanted to emphasize Mindy's
                        tendency to clutter a space with her interests. Her room is filled to brim with her collections,
                        but also a mess that emphasizes her personality as a loner.
                    </p>

                    </div>
                    <p> Finally, I put Mindy in the room to show the culmination of the overall concept. I wanted a big
                        focus of the enviroment to be the dim purple lighting versus the harsh white light of the
                        computer screen.
                    </p>
                    <p> When pitching the concept I described Mindy's Room as: </p>

                            the pleasure of an isolated life online rather than real social connections. When receiving
                            a mysterious message on her computer, Mindy must make an uneasy decision.

                            scale, taking into account the size of the different furniture pieces we wanted our room to
                            feature. My initial floor plan was based off my own sophomore university dormitory.

                        <p> Modeling the room and its respective furniture and objects was the first time I had
                            undertaken a large-scale modeling project in Maya. I initially struggled with modeling, as
                            it was a form of art creation I had never properly engaged with until this point. However,
                            with the help of various online tutorials, I was able to create all the furniture I desired,
                            as well as other objects that helped build the enviroment.

                        <p> The main setpiece of my film was the desk, so I made sure that this item was the most
                            detailed area of furniture. Mindy's personality was to be expressed through the mess of
                            the area, highlighting her affinity towards material escapes like figurines, energy drinks,
                            and electronics. I wanted the space to feel lived in, leaving the empty cans of drinks and
                            messy wires of her computer.

                        <p> After adding textures to my desk area, I decided to add my desired purple ambience lighting
                            for the room and intense white light of the computer screen. The initial test renders gave
                            me a good idea of how the lighting interacted with my room's furniture.

                            believe I was able to successfully capture Mindy's sense for collecting, as well as the
                            clutter and decorations that reveal aspects of her personality. For her posters, I used
                            various images of my old art, adjusting colors to have them fit the aesthetic of the
                            room.

                            <p> I knew from the start of this project, translating Mindy's 2D-friendly design to a 3D
                                medium would be a challenge. From her pitch-black hair that varies at different angles
                                when drawing to her large coat that hides most of her body, I knew this design was not
                                the most 3D-friendly. It was initially
                                recommended to me by my professor that I consider changing Mindy's design to feature
                                more tight-fitting clothing, as it would be more easier to adapt. However, this aspect
                                of her design was something I was passionate about
                                keeping, so I opted to keep this design quality and learn how to adapt it into an
                                approachable 3D model.

                                I wanted to land on a design that seems otherwordly and uncanny, but still approachable

                            <p> There were several difficulties when it came to translating Mindy to a 3D format. For
                                one, her hair from a front and side profile in 2D does not work in a 3D space. When
                                drawing her, I would make sure her hair tufts stuck out when viewing her from both of
                                these angles. However, when working in 3D, this same affect isn't technically possible.

                            <p>To deal with this, I thought of other 3D films that had to deal with this issue.
                                I thought of "The Peanuts Movie," and how they had to adapt their 3D models in a way
                                that matched Charlie Brown's 2D design. Although my skills were not at a level I felt
                                confident creating a 3D model that could update itself at any angle, I did find a
                                workaround that would fit my project. I made the textures for Mindy's hair pitch black,
                                absorbing minimal light. I created 3 hair tufts, two that protrude from a front facing
                                view, and one that protrudes from a side facing view. This way, when viewed at either of
                                these angles, the 3D design would mimic that of my 2D one, which I think lended itself
                                to a more appealing look for Mindy's character.

                            <p> After finalizing Mindy's room and model, I had to plan how I would go about animating my
                                film. I wanted to be sure that my film could get across a sense of horror, suspense, and
                                mystery. With only a week to animate, I created a storyboard that got across these
                                desired aspects, while keeping the time short and animation minimal. I did not want to
                                trap myself by planning a project that would require complicated animation, so I aimed
                                to use camera movements to portray the movement of Mindy. However, I did want to
                                practice my abilities for complicated animation, so I did incorporate a short walk cycle
                                into the end film.

                            <p> Perhaps one of the most important scenes of any film is an establishing shot, and it was
                                crucial that I used this aspect of filmmaking with the short time I had. I decided to
                                start
                                the film from the perspective of Mindy's computer, as if it is watching Mindy's room,
                                and stops its gaze once Mindy enters the room. I also created a titlecard, which would
                                serve as both the name of my film and clueing in the audience to the fact that we inside
                                Mindy's space. </p>

                            <p> With the suggestion of my professor, I decided to introduce Mindy to the film with her
                                shadow being cast against the wall. To achieve this effect, I
                                slightly had to manipulate the lighting and spacing of the scene. For one, the door
                                entrance to the wall would not actually cast a shadow from where a character would walk
                                in. Also, there was no light emitting from the side of the room that would be needed to
                                cast the desired shadow. To rectify this, I utilized a model of Mindy that would be
                                invisible to the render, but still cast a shadow when affected by light. I also added
                                small but intense light that would illuminate the wall where I wanted the shadow to be
                                cast. With these adjustments, I was able to achieve my desired effect, even if they
                                techinically broke the laws of physics. </p>

                            <p> This idea of breaking physics to create the ideal scene was continued into the next
                                shot. To establish the fact that Mindy is returning home from school, I included the
                                dropping background. In a show of exhaustion, she takes a deep breath and heads into her
                                room. In this shot, I wanted to show the door closing, so the transition of lighting in
                                Mindy's room is understandable to the audience. However, based on the layout of the
                                room, Mindy's door would shut onto her body. For timing efficiency, I found a workaround
                                to this fact. Rather than altering the timing so Mindy walks away before the door
                                closes, I decided to keep the scene short to avoid unneccarry render times. To do this,
                                I made the closing door invisible to the render, but it still effecting the
                                enviroment as it closed. This way, both Mindy's actions in the door way and the closing
                                of the door could occur in one concurrent scene without confusing the viewer.

                                is unexpected and frightening. I knew I would eventually add sound effects to emphasize
                                this, but I also wanted to ensure Mindy's movements emphasized this fear. I set the
                                perspective to first-person to force the viewer to experience the unexpected
                                notification firsthand, therefore allowing them to empathsize with Mindy's plight;
                                although they might not be able to discern the reason for her fear just yet.

                            <p> After Mindy views the unsettling notification I wanted to have Mindy's immediate
                                reaction unclear to the audience. A lot of the intrigue of this film is the unknown
                                nature of Mindy's decision, either pressing "yes" or "no" to her computer's notfication.
                                This still scene of her just taking in the information again, blinking as if she might
                                be misreading it, has the audience question what Mindy is thinking when taking in this
                                new information. I used blend shapes to manipulate Mindy's eyes and eyebrows, as it was
                                Mindy's only facial movement in the project. This way, I could avoid spending time on a
                                facial rig for this specific project.

                            <p> In the end, Mindy's decision is left up for interpretation. What option she clicks
                                remains unknown, only the aftermath of the room being completely empty is known to the
                                audience. I wanted this short film to have a memorable ending, and I think leaving the
                                audience with questions aided this goal.

                            <p> Overall, I learned so much through the creation of Mindy's Room. From modeling, rigging,
                                texturing, lighting, to animation; this project covered a variety of skills in using
                                Autodesk Maya. From this project, I've felt confident using Maya ever since. I am
                                excited to continue to use Maya for animation projects, and I look forward to creating
                                more stories through 3D animation in the future.
