                    <p> This project was created for the Animation Club’s Spring 2025 Animation Jam by Josh Goldman
                        and me. Under a strict one-week deadline, we strategically leveraged free assets from Fab and
                        advanced motion capture technology to streamline our production process. I adapted a
                        pre-existing monster rig’s crawl animation to seamlessly integrate it into our scene, taking
                        care to prevent clipping while enhancing the facial and mouth movements for added effect.

                    <p> With the MoCap motion data captured, we now just had to import those animations onto the
                        characters for our project. For the prisoner character, I utilized Unreal Engine’s MetaHuman
                        Creator, incorporating a control rig to refine the animations and ensuring that the wrists
                        remained
                        accurately aligned with the prison shackles. Concurrently, Josh expertly retargeted and modified
                        the Viking character from Fab to embody a medieval prison guard, while I fine-tuned the guard
                        animations to manage dynamic lighting from the torch without compromising visibility.For the

                    <p> This project significantly expanded my technical expertise in several areas. I honed my skills
                        in motion capture integration, rigging, and animation editing, while also deepening my
                        understanding of lighting techniques and dynamic scene composition. These experiences enhanced
                        my ability to tell compelling stories visually and improved my overall workflow efficiency in a
                        high-pressure, production-oriented environment.
