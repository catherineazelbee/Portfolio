                    <p> This is a two-hit combo attack created for Blizzard's World of Warcraft 2025 Student Art
                        Competition! I'm competing in the animation track with a two-hit combo attack. For my animation,
                        I wanted to convey movement of an initial powerful attack, followed by a fake-out,
                        leading into a final pull-back to take an enemy's head off. I chose the Azri rig, which posed
                        some challenges with the characters long flowing hair and poncho, and even more with trying to
                        not have the back of her scythe puncture herself. Navigating the problems taught me valuable
                        lessons, such as secondary animation and emphasis with her hair and attention to detail with her
                        clothes and scythe. In the end, this project was a great exercise in game attack animation!</p>
