                    <p> The final projects for Animation Basics was to create a talent show performance through a
                        character of our creation. Since it was our 3D project, we were advised one great piece of
                        advice: Simplicity. To avoid possible walk cycles, complicated animations, and other hiccups
                        that could stunt our progress it was advised that we kept our characters as simple as possible.
                        For my approach, I was inspired by simple mascot characters from the likes of Sanrio, wanting to
                        create a character with a readable design and strong shape language. </p>

                    <p> I decided on the design of a magical bunny, sticking with color scheme 3. I wanted her to resemble 
                        a toy from my childhood that I've always been attached to. As a child, I liked to imagine 
                        that my toys did have magic powers, so this was a sort of realization for that idea! </p>
