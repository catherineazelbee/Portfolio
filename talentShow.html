                    <p> The final projects for Animation Basics was to create a talent show performance through a
                        character of our creation. Since it was our 3D project, we were advised one great piece of
                        advice: Simplicity. To avoid possible walk cycles, complicated animations, and other hiccups
                        that could stunt our progress it was advised that we kept our characters as simple as possible.
                        For my approach, I was inspired by simple mascot characters from the likes of Sanrio, wanting to
                        create a character with a readable design and strong shape language. </p>

                    <p> I decided on the design of a magical bunny, sticking with color scheme 3. I wanted her to
                        resemble
                        a toy from my childhood that I've always been attached to. As a child, I liked to imagine
                        that my toys did have magic powers, so this was a sort of realization for that idea! </p>

                <div class="project-info-text">
                    <p> This project was my first real introduction to 3D modeling and I initially struggled with
                        bringing my 2D design into 3D. However, with the help of my professor, I approached the modeling
                        by blocking out the main shapes (face, ears, dress) and then combining them into a single geo.
                        This way, modeling became much less of a challenge and my character greatly resembled my
                        references. </p>

                <div class="project-info-text">
                <p> In this project, we were recommended to use blend shapes for all of our character movements. Rigging
                    was a relatively new concept, and with only a few weeks to complete the project it was recommended
                    we stick to the Maya Shape Editor. However, since my character had limbs, I thought blend shapes
                    might become limiting for what I wanted to accomplish. So, with the help of the Animation Tools
                    professor, I created a simple rig for my character. This way, her limbs and body were easily
                    controllable. I still did utilize blend shapes for expression, ear, and dress movements, but the
                    practice of creating a simple rig and weight painting were invaluable to me for future coursework. </p>
