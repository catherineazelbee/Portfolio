                    <p> Our final project for Animation Basics was to create a talent show performance through a
                        character of our creation. Since it was our first 3D project, we were advised one great piece of
                        advice: <i>Simplicity</i>. To avoid possible walk cycles, complicated animations, and other
                        hiccups
                        that could stunt our progress it was advised that we kept our characters as simple as possible.
                        For my approach, I was inspired by simple mascot characters from the likes of Sanrio, wanting to
                        create a character with a readable design and strong shape language. </p>

                    <p> I decided on the design of a magical bunny, sticking with color scheme 3. I wanted her to
                        resemble a toy from my childhood that I've always been attached to. I gave the character a wand,
                        and while I was not quite sure as how I'd utilize this prop in the final project, I knew I
                        wanted my character to have magical abilities. As a child, I liked to imagine that my toys did
                        have magic powers, so this was a sort of realization for that idea!

                <div class="project-info-text">
                    <p> This project was my first real introduction to 3D modeling and I initially struggled with
                        bringing my 2D design into 3D. However, with the help of my professor, I approached the modeling
                        by blocking out the main shapes (face, ears, dress) and then combining them into a single geo.
                        This way, modeling became much less of a challenge and my character greatly resembled my
                        references. </p>

                <div class="project-info-text">
                    <p> In this project, we were recommended to use blend shapes for all of our character movements.
                        Rigging was a relatively new concept, and with only a few weeks to complete the project it was
                        recommended we stick to the Maya Shape Editor. However, since my character had limbs, I thought
                        blend shapes might become limiting for what I wanted to accomplish. So, with the help of the
                        Animation Tools professor, I created a simple rig for my character. This way, her limbs and body
                        were easily controllable. I still did utilize blend shapes for expression, ear, and dress
                        movements, but the practice of creating a simple rig and weight painting were invaluable to me
                        for future coursework. </p>

                <p> I decided early on into my project that my final film would be less than thirty seconds long.
                    With a week to animate and render, I knew keeping my project within these time restraints would be
                    the most beneficial for my project. So, with this knowledge, I needed to make a film that got it's
                    point across in that alotted time. I knew I wanted to go for humour, so I tried to thing of ways my
                    character could fail at a certain action, resulting in a finale where she is defeated. I thought the
                    juxtaposition of a cute character being heartbroken at their own mistakes combined both my
                    tendencies towards dark humour and tragedy. </p>

            <div class="project-info-text">
                <p> In the end, I was able to keep my project under thirty seconds while accomplishing my desire for a
                    funny, yet tragic, talent show performance for my character. The final film was edited with Adobe
                    After Effects and Premiere Pro with sound effects from Freesound and Pixabay.</p>
