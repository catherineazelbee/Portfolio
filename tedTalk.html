                <div class="project-info-text">
                    <p> The second project in Animation Basics was a group project that had to be based around a TedTalk
                        of our group's choice. Our group chose one about sleep, explaining the harms the modern person's
                        sleep schedule has on their psyche, and how rethinking our sleep schedule can lend itself to an
                        improved quality of life. The project has to be at least two minutes, and the portion of the
                        talk we chose lent itself to this short time span. We did have to restructure some of the speech
                        to fit this timeframe, leading to us editing the audio to create a clear structure for
                        storytelling.

                        Something I wanted to focus on in this project was the animation to be consistent across all
                        shots. I went ahead and designed a character turnaround sheet and animation, getting feedback
                        from my teammates so I could finalize a design we would all be happy with for our main
                        character. I was inspired by other TedAnimated character designs, wanting to create an easily
                        animatable design with appealing, round shape language. Since we never planned on having our
                        character viewed from behind, I only focused on front facing views for the sake of time. </p>
                </div>
                <h1> Animatic Development </h1>
                <div class="project-info-text">
                    <p> Our group of three decided to split the project so we would each work on a third of the entire
                        project. We all worked on our alotted sections of the audio: Issy taking the first 41 seconds,
                        myself taking the next 27 seconds, Fia taking the next 44 seconds, and myself taking the final
                        17 seconds. This division gave us all an equal amount of work of around 42 seconds each, with
                        each of us being resposible for animatic, animation, and coloring of our assigned time frames.
                    </p>

                <video class="project-info-animatic" src="TedTalk_Animatic_1.mp4" type="video/mp4" autoplay controls
                    width="1920" height="1080"></video>
                <!-- Animation Development -->
                <div class="project-info-text">
                    <p> While we were all able to complete our designated animatic sections, there were some setbacks in
                        the completion of this project. Due to unexpected circumstances, our original division of roles
                        had to reconsidered. Fia would not be able to work on the project for an extended period of
                        time, so in order to have a completed project, I took it upon myself to do the character
                        animation for these parts. Eventually, Fia was able to work again, doing the background
                        animation for their original shots and the background painting for my ending shots.
                    </p>
                    <p> In the end, I believe this project was a good practice in 2D Animation, focusing on the 12
                        Principles of Animation in my work. While I did have to do extra animation work, I think it
                        helped me prepare for unexpected complications in group work, as well as how to find solutions
                        to a problem without getting stuck. Despite these setbacks, I am proud of the project my group
                        and I were able to create.
