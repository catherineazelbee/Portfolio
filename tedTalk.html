                    <p> The second project in Animation Basics was a group project that had to be based around a TedTalk
                        of our group's choice. Our group chose one about sleep, explaining the harms the modern person's
                        sleep schedule has on their psyche, and how rethinking our sleep schedule can lend itself to an
                        improved quality of life. The project has to be at least two minutes, and we felt as if the
                        portion we
                        chose lent itself to this short time span. We did have to restructure some of the speech to fit
                        this timeframe and
                        still have a clear story structure, leading to us editing the audio to create this clear
                        structure.

                    <p> Since we split the project so we would all be doing around a third of the shots in full, I
                        wanted the animation to be consistent across all shots. I went ahead and designed this character
                        turnaround sheet and animation, getting feedback from my teammated so I could finalize a design
                        we would all be happy with. I was inspired by other TedAnimated character designs,
                        wanting to create an easily animatable design with appealing shape language. Since we never
                        planned on having our character viewed from behind, I only focused on front facing views. </p>
