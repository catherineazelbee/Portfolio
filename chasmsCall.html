                        100 hours creating this project, and learned new skills like 3D compositing and animation in
                        Blender. Through this project, I also created my own workflow for combining Unreal Engine
                        environments and particle systems with Blender character animation in After Effects.

                            <p> For this project, I took a lot of inspiration from Into the Spiderverse and Batman
                                Beyond. These pieces of concept art served as the main style inspiration, a night city
                                lit by bright blues and reds. I especially was inspired by the Spiderverse art of the
                                city, and the bright lights emitting from below the buildings giving off a great sense of
                                depth. </p>

                        <div class="project-info-text">
                            <p> A big challenge I had when creating this project was my desire two use two different
                                animation programs. While wanting to utilize the faster rendering and Lumen capabilities
                                of Unreal Engine, I found an awesome rig that was only compatible with Blender. While it
                                would've been ideal to directly import my rig and animation directly into Unreal, the
                                Blender-specific constraints of the rig I found did not make this possible. Therefore, I
                                had to find a way to combine my Unreal Scene with my character animation.

                            <p> To create a believable final render, I utilized the 360 camera in Unreal Engine, or
                                Scene Capture Cube, to get an HDRI of my environment. I then imported that HDRI into
                                Blender, allowing it to light my scene. I added additional lighting to create a more
                                believable render, specifically adding a strong blue light to reflect the intense glow
                                of the city. I then rendered with a shadow map, and used my EXR render in After Effects
                                to composite the character animation believably into the environment. </p>

                            <p> Initially, I had wanted my scene to be accompanied by a torrential downpour of rain.
                                While I axed this detail in the final version due to time constraints, I added it in this
                                alternative version. To create the rain effect, I used two Unreal Engine particle
                                systems, one for the rain itself and the second for ground splash. I rendered out these
                                two particle systems as individual EXR sequences, allowing me to make specific edits and
                                color correction within After Effects to have them best fit the scene.

                                    <p> To use the rig, I had to take on the new task of learning how to animate in
                                        Blender. Although I struggled with the UI and Blender-specific features, I
                                        eventually got the hang of this new animation program and became comfortable
                                        with the program. This challenge, with the set camera movement given to
                                        participants, allowed me to really push the character animation by cheating the
                                        camera.
