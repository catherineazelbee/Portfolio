                        100 hours creating this project, and learned new skills like 3D compositing and animation in
                        Blender. Through this project, I also created my own workflow for combining Unreal Engine
                        environments and particle systems with Blender character animation in After Effects.

                            <p> For this project, I took a lot of inspiration from Into the Spiderverse and Batman
                                Beyond. These pieces of concept art served as the main style inspiration, a night city
                                lit by bright blues and reds. I especially was inspired by the Spiderverse art of the
                                city, and the bright lights emitting from below the buldings giving off a great sense of
                                depth. </p>

                            <p> A big challenge I had when creating this project was my desire two use two different
                                animation programs. While wanting to utilize the faster rendering and Lumen capabilities
                                of Unreal Engine, I found an awesome rig that was only compatible with Blender. While it
                                would've been ideal to directly import my rig and animation directly into Unreal, the
                                Blender-specific contraints of the rig I found did not make this possible. Therefore, I
                                had to find a way to combine my Unreal Scene with my character animation.

                            <p> To create a believable final render, I utilized the 360 camera in Unreal Engine, or
                                Scene Capture Cube, to get an HDRI of my environment. I then imported that HDRI into
                                Blender, allowing it to light my scene. I added additional lighting to create a </p>
